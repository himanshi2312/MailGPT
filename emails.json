This allows users to mark business visits seamlessly while providing the option to tag deviations for personal trips, ensuring these are excluded from business visits.\r\nThis approach offers enhanced compliance and visibility by capturing end-to-end information on client interactions and visit patterns. Additionally, with our solution, all visit data can be seamlessly synced with your CRM, creating a unified\r\n and accurate view of client engagements\r\nHere&#39;s a quick case study for your reference on the similar use case. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thu, Jan 16, 2025 at 12:36 PM Agheda, Sanjay &lt;sanjay.agheda@georgfischer.com&gt; wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHi Himanshi,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGreetings for the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, all good so far thanks and hope the same at your end too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing the query response sheet.\r\n\r\nI have one last question for your team about the auto stop of the gps tracking in the mileage tracking module, which i raised during our last demo call to Manohar, so just to confirm the splitting of the trips is not an option with the auto tracking right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI mean when i start the trip in the morning and start tracking, and when i make multiple stops in-between during the day and when the day ends, the app stops tracking and the whole journey including multiple stops is counted as one single trip and we cannot\r\n split the trip in separate trips right?

I enjoyed our conversation and am looking forward to our in-person meeting on Monday at 2:00 PM in Sharjah to discuss how Dice can enhance procurement operations at GECO Mechanical & Electrical Ltd.\r\n\r\nWith $300M in annual spend, 6,000 POs, and 15,000 invoices, streamlining supplier onboarding, validation, intake, e-negotiation, auctioning, PO acceptance, and invoicing is key. Dice seamlessly integrates with Procore and SAP ECC, enabling real-time tracking, compliance, and automation for project-based procurement.\r\n\r\nIndustry leaders like GMR Group, Bajaj Electricals, and Tolaram Group use Dice to streamline procurement and cut costs. GMR improved vendor onboarding by 30%, Bajaj Electricals reduced procurement cycles by 40%.We have also been working with Tolaram and GF Cory's in the Middle East.\r\n\r\nExcited to explore how we can bring similar efficiencies to GECO.

I enjoyed our conversation and am looking forward to our in-person meeting on Monday at 2:00 PM in Sharjah to discuss how Dice can enhance procurement operations at GECO Mechanical & Electrical Ltd.\r\n\r\n                  With $300M in annual spend, 6,000 POs, and 15,000 invoices, streamlining supplier onboarding, validation, intake, e-negotiation, auctioning, PO acceptance, and invoicing is key. Dice seamlessly integrates with Procore and SAP ECC, enabling real-time tracking, compliance, and automation for project-based procurement.\r\n\r\n                  Industry leaders like GMR Group, Bajaj Electricals, and Tolaram Group use Dice to streamline procurement and cut costs. GMR improved vendor onboarding by 30%, Bajaj Electricals reduced procurement cycles by 40%.We have also been working with Tolaram and GF Cory's in the Middle East.\r\n\r\n                  Excited to explore how we can bring similar efficiencies to GECO.

I enjoyed our conversation and am looking forward to our in-person meeting on Monday at 2:00 PM in Sharjah to discuss how Dice can enhance procurement operations at GECO Mechanical & Electrical Ltd.\r\n\r\nWith $300M in annual spend, 6,000 POs, and 15,000 invoices, streamlining supplier onboarding, validation, intake, e-negotiation, auctioning, PO acceptance, and invoicing is key. Dice seamlessly integrates with Procore and SAP ECC, enabling real-time tracking, compliance, and automation for project-based procurement.\r\n\r\nIndustry leaders like GMR Group, Bajaj Electricals, and Tolaram Group use Dice to streamline procurement and cut costs. GMR improved vendor onboarding by 30%, Bajaj Electricals reduced procurement cycles by 40%.We have also been working with Tolaram and GF Cory's in the Middle East.\r\n\r\nExcited to explore how we can bring similar efficiencies to GECO.

I enjoyed our conversation and am looking forward to our in-person meeting on Monday at 2:00 PM in Sharjah to discuss how Dice can enhance procurement operations at GECO Mechanical & Electrical Ltd.\r\n\r\nWith $300M in annual spend, 6,000 POs, and 15,000 invoices, streamlining supplier onboarding, validation, intake, e-negotiation, auctioning, PO acceptance, and invoicing is key. Dice seamlessly integrates with Procore and SAP ECC, enabling real-time tracking, compliance, and automation for project-based procurement.\r\n\r\nIndustry leaders like GMR Group, Bajaj Electricals, and Tolaram Group use Dice to streamline procurement and cut costs. GMR improved vendor onboarding by 30%, Bajaj Electricals reduced procurement cycles by 40%.We have also been working with Tolaram and GF Cory's in the Middle East.\r\n\r\nExcited to explore how we can bring similar efficiencies to GECO.

This allows users to mark business visits seamlessly while providing the option to tag deviations for personal trips, ensuring these are excluded from business visits.\r\n\r\nThis approach offers enhanced compliance and visibility by capturing end-to-end information on client interactions and visit patterns. Additionally, with our solution, all visit data can be seamlessly synced with your CRM, creating a unified and accurate view of client engagements\r\n\r\nHere's a quick case study for your reference on the similar use case.\r\n\r\nOn Thu, Jan 16, 2025 at 12:36 PM Agheda, Sanjay <sanjay.agheda@georgfischer.com<mailto:sanjay.agheda@georgfischer.com>> wrote:\r\nHi Himanshi,\r\n\r\nGreetings for the day.\r\n\r\nYes, all good so far thanks and hope the same at your end too.\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing the query response sheet.\r\nI have one last question for your team about the auto stop of the gps tracking in the mileage tracking module, which i raised during our last demo call to Manohar, so just to confirm the splitting of the trips is not an option with the auto tracking right.\r\n\r\nI mean when i start the trip in the morning and start tracking, and when i make multiple stops in-between during the day and when the day ends, the app stops tracking and the whole journey including multiple stops is counted as one single trip and we cannot split the trip in separate trips right?

This allows users to mark business visits seamlessly while providing the option to tag deviations for personal trips, ensuring these are excluded from business visits.\r\nThis approach offers enhanced compliance and visibility by capturing end-to-end information on client interactions and visit patterns.

I enjoyed our conversation and am looking forward to our in-person meeting on\r\nMonday at 2:00 PM in Sharjah to discuss how\r\nDice can enhance procurement operations at\r\nGECO Mechanical &amp; Electrical Ltd.\r\nWith $300M in annual spend, 6,000 POs, and 15,000 invoices, streamlining\r\nsupplier onboarding, validation, intake, e-negotiation, auctioning, PO acceptance, and invoicing is key.\r\nDice seamlessly integrates with\r\nProcore and SAP ECC, enabling\r\nreal-time tracking, compliance, and automation for project-based procurement.\r\nIndustry leaders like GMR Group, Bajaj Electricals, and Tolaram Group use\r\nDice to streamline procurement and cut costs.\r\nGMR improved\r\nvendor onboarding by 30%,\r\nBajaj Electricals reduced\r\nprocurement cycles by 40%.We have also been working with Tolaram and GF Cory&#39;s in the Middle East.\r\nExcited to explore how we can bring similar efficiencies to GECO.

This allows users to mark business visits seamlessly while providing the option to tag deviations for personal trips, ensuring these are excluded from business visits.\r\nThis approach offers enhanced compliance and visibility by capturing end-to-end information on client interactions and visit patterns.

Does Expense Tracking System’s APIs work two-way integration? Does it support SOAP based web services or REST API protocols.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. Any prior experience for Integration with Oracle E-Business Suite (ERP)? Any case study with Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3. Few additional attributes are required to generate payable invoices in EBS (e.g., Org ID, Vendor ID, Vendor Site ID),\r\n\r\n     Kindly confirm in case Expense Tracking System can accommodate new attributes in GUI as well as in APIs.\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n4. Is there any specific API endpoint for uploading or retrieving attachments?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n5. Is it possible to share detailed API documentation for the Expense Tracking System, including supported endpoints, request/response formats, and payload examples?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n6. What authentication mechanisms APIs supports (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys)?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n7. Is there any IP whitelisting option or additional security requirements that needs to be configured?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n8. What is the API payload size and call limits for API requests?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n9. Is there any maximum size limit for attachments and what are the supported formats (e.g., PDF, JPEG, PNG)?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n10. How integration errors are communicated (e.g., error codes, response messages)?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n11. Does APIs support retry mechanisms for failed transactions?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n12. Is there a sandbox or test environment we can use for integration testing?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n13. What format and data structure is required for sending batch element entries (e.g., JSON, XML)?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n14. Is there a unique identifier for each element entry to ensure no duplicate processing in Oracle?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n15. Is there an acknowledgment mechanism to confirm successful receipt of processed results in Expense Tracking System?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n16. Does Expense Tracking Software APIs support attachments (e.g., expense receipts) along with batch entries?\r\n\r\n        If yes, how are these attachments linked to a specific transaction?\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n17. How does Expense Tracking System handle invoice status updates sent back from Oracle?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n18. How frequently should the payment status updates be sent to Expense Tracking System (real-time, scheduled batches)?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n19. Is there a way to log or track changes for audit purposes?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n20. Please outline the expected response times (latency) and any defined timeouts for the Expense Tracking System APIs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n21. How does API versioning and backward compatibility is being handled.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n22. Does ExTS supports bulk upload to Employee Master through Excel / CSV file.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n23. Does ExTS supports bulk upload through excel / CSV file to other masters like Expense Type / Account Codes etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n______\r\n \r\nSanjay Agheda\r\nIT / LMS Coordinator\r\nPhone +971 4 2894670\r\nDirect +971 4 823 5289\r\nMobile +971 56 399 3998\r\nsanjay.agheda@georgfischer.com\r\n \r\nGF Corys\r\nP.O.

This allows users to mark business visits seamlessly while providing the option to tag deviations for personal trips, ensuring these are excluded from business visits.\r\nThis approach offers enhanced compliance and visibility by capturing end-to-end information on client interactions and visit patterns. Additionally, with our solution, all visit data can be seamlessly synced with your CRM, creating a unified\r\n and accurate view of client engagements\r\nHere&#39;s a quick case study for your reference on the similar use case. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thu, Jan 16, 2025 at 12:36 PM Agheda, Sanjay &lt;sanjay.agheda@georgfischer.com&gt; wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHi Himanshi,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGreetings for the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, all good so far thanks and hope the same at your end too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing the query response sheet.\r\n\r\nI have one last question for your team about the auto stop of the gps tracking in the mileage tracking module, which i raised during our last demo call to Manohar, so just to confirm the splitting of the trips is not an option with the auto tracking right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI mean when i start the trip in the morning and start tracking, and when i make multiple stops in-between during the day and when the day ends, the app stops tracking and the whole journey including multiple stops is counted as one single trip and we cannot\r\n split the trip in separate trips right?

The team conducts the RFQ, followed by technical and commercial evaluations, eventually leading to a blanket purchase order.Here&#39;s we can add a layer of Catalogue based E-Procurement on top of Purchase Requisition creation in Oracle as a single door intake process. AI Agents for Process ImprovementsLower-Value Purchases – These transactions require significant manual intervention, often delaying procurement cycles. Our AI-driven procurement automation solution can streamline this by handling the RFQ process autonomously while keeping you in the loop for key decision points. This reduces procurement overhead while ensuring efficiency, compliance, and cost optimization.To dive deeper into the second use case, we envision an AI-driven workflow where:The AI Agent identifies relevant suppliers from the master database based on category, pricing, and past transactions.It then generates and sends RFQs, tracks responses, and negotiates autonomously based on predefined parameters and market insights.Once optimal supplier terms are reached, the AI Agent compiles a comparative analysis and drafts a Purchase Order (PO) for the L1 supplier.The system ensures full auditability and seamless integration into your existing ERP and approval workflows.AI Agents for Spend AnalyticsAgents to collect data from Jagger, Oracle Fusion &amp; other DMS deployed at Lafarge. The data will get stored in Vector DatabaseUser will be able to query &amp; the database &amp; AI Agent should create the chart/graphs in real-time.  Can we connect sometime this week to deep dive on these use cases?@Himanshi Joshi, kindly coordinate with Anil to get the preferred time slot for the AI Agent discussion. --Sonam+91 704 569 6971 /+971 56 982 3620dice.techOn Thu, Feb 20, 2025 at 1:27 PM Anil Kumar GOPALAKRISHNAN &lt;anil.kumar@lafargeholcim.com&gt; wrote:Dear HimanshiYou may please block the calendar at 3pm or 5pmThanks &amp;\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nAnil KUMAR | Procurement ManagerE&amp;C and Maint. Services. | LEC &amp; GeocycleLafarge Emirates Cement LLC - A member of Holcim GroupIdhn,Habhab ,Fujairah,UAEP.O.Box: 29966, Ras Al Khaimah - UAETel (+971) (7)\r\n2044702 / (+971) (7) 2044888, Ext- 404Mobile (+971) (55) 7008397 - Fax (+971) (7) 2448620Email : anil.kumar@lafargeholcim.comwww.lafarge.ae / www.holcim.comFind us on Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Instagram and YouTube \r\n\r\n On Thu, Feb 20, 2025 at 11:47 AM Himanshi Joshi &lt;himanshi.joshi@dice.tech&gt; wrote:Hi Anil , If Tuesday 4 PM works for you , please let me know.

This allows users to mark business visits seamlessly while providing the option to tag deviations for personal trips, ensuring these are excluded from business visits.\r\nThis approach offers enhanced compliance and visibility by capturing end-to-end information on client interactions and visit patterns. Additionally, with our solution, all visit data can be seamlessly synced with your CRM, creating a unified\r\n and accurate view of client engagements\r\nHere&#39;s a quick case study for your reference on the similar use case. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thu, Jan 16, 2025 at 12:36 PM Agheda, Sanjay &lt;sanjay.agheda@georgfischer.com&gt; wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHi Himanshi,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGreetings for the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, all good so far thanks and hope the same at your end too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing the query response sheet.\r\n\r\nI have one last question for your team about the auto stop of the gps tracking in the mileage tracking module, which i raised during our last demo call to Manohar, so just to confirm the splitting of the trips is not an option with the auto tracking right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI mean when i start the trip in the morning and start tracking, and when i make multiple stops in-between during the day and when the day ends, the app stops tracking and the whole journey including multiple stops is counted as one single trip and we cannot\r\n split the trip in separate trips right?

Does Expense Tracking System’s APIs work two-way integration? Does it support SOAP based web services or REST API protocols.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. Any prior experience for Integration with Oracle E-Business Suite (ERP)? Any case study with Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3. Few additional attributes are required to generate payable invoices in EBS (e.g., Org ID, Vendor ID, Vendor Site ID),\r\n\r\n     Kindly confirm in case Expense Tracking System can accommodate new attributes in GUI as well as in APIs.\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n4. Is there any specific API endpoint for uploading or retrieving attachments?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n5. Is it possible to share detailed API documentation for the Expense Tracking System, including supported endpoints, request/response formats, and payload examples?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n6. What authentication mechanisms APIs supports (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys)?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n7. Is there any IP whitelisting option or additional security requirements that needs to be configured?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n8. What is the API payload size and call limits for API requests?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n9. Is there any maximum size limit for attachments and what are the supported formats (e.g., PDF, JPEG, PNG)?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n10. How integration errors are communicated (e.g., error codes, response messages)?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n11. Does APIs support retry mechanisms for failed transactions?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n12. Is there a sandbox or test environment we can use for integration testing?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n13. What format and data structure is required for sending batch element entries (e.g., JSON, XML)?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n14. Is there a unique identifier for each element entry to ensure no duplicate processing in Oracle?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n15. Is there an acknowledgment mechanism to confirm successful receipt of processed results in Expense Tracking System?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n16. Does Expense Tracking Software APIs support attachments (e.g., expense receipts) along with batch entries?\r\n\r\n        If yes, how are these attachments linked to a specific transaction?\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n17. How does Expense Tracking System handle invoice status updates sent back from Oracle?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n18. How frequently should the payment status updates be sent to Expense Tracking System (real-time, scheduled batches)?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n19. Is there a way to log or track changes for audit purposes?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n20. Please outline the expected response times (latency) and any defined timeouts for the Expense Tracking System APIs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n21. How does API versioning and backward compatibility is being handled.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n22. Does ExTS supports bulk upload to Employee Master through Excel / CSV file.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n23. Does ExTS supports bulk upload through excel / CSV file to other masters like Expense Type / Account Codes etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n______\r\n \r\nSanjay Agheda\r\nIT / LMS Coordinator\r\nPhone +971 4 2894670\r\nDirect +971 4 823 5289\r\nMobile +971 56 399 3998\r\nsanjay.agheda@georgfischer.com\r\n \r\nGF Corys\r\nP.O.

    "body": "Hi Anil & Sajin,\r\n\r\nThanks for having us at your office.\r\n\r\nFollowing our discussion, we’ve outlined the key procurement uuse\r\ncases identified during our discussion and how an AI Agentic approach can\r\noptimize them.\r\n\r\n*Repeatable Purchases* – The current process involves an end-user raising a\r\nPurchase Requisition (PR), which, post-approval, moves to the Procurement\r\nteam. The team conducts the RFQ, followed by technical and commercial\r\nevaluations, eventually leading to a *blanket purchase order*.\r\n\r\n   - Here's we can add a layer of Catalogue based E-Procurement on top of\r\n   Purchase Requisition creation in Oracle as a single door intake process.\r\n\r\n*AI Agents for Process Improvements*\r\n\r\n   - *Lower-Value Purchases *– These transactions require significant\r\n   manual intervention, often delaying procurement cycles.

The team conducts the RFQ, followed by technical and commercial evaluations, eventually leading to a blanket purchase order.Here&#39;s we can add a layer of Catalogue based E-Procurement on top of Purchase Requisition creation in Oracle as a single door intake process. AI Agents for Process ImprovementsLower-Value Purchases – These transactions require significant manual intervention, often delaying procurement cycles. Our AI-driven procurement automation solution can streamline this by handling the RFQ process autonomously while keeping you in the loop for key decision points. This reduces procurement overhead while ensuring efficiency, compliance, and cost optimization.To dive deeper into the second use case, we envision an AI-driven workflow where:The AI Agent identifies relevant suppliers from the master database based on category, pricing, and past transactions.It then generates and sends RFQs, tracks responses, and negotiates autonomously based on predefined parameters and market insights.Once optimal supplier terms are reached, the AI Agent compiles a comparative analysis and drafts a Purchase Order (PO) for the L1 supplier.The system ensures full auditability and seamless integration into your existing ERP and approval workflows.AI Agents for Spend AnalyticsAgents to collect data from Jagger, Oracle Fusion &amp; other DMS deployed at Lafarge. The data will get stored in Vector DatabaseUser will be able to query &amp; the database &amp; AI Agent should create the chart/graphs in real-time.  Can we connect sometime this week to deep dive on these use cases?@Himanshi Joshi, kindly coordinate with Anil to get the preferred time slot for the AI Agent discussion. --Sonam+91 704 569 6971 /+971 56 982 3620dice.techOn Thu, Feb 20, 2025 at 1:27 PM Anil Kumar GOPALAKRISHNAN &lt;anil.kumar@lafargeholcim.com&gt; wrote:Dear HimanshiYou may please block the calendar at 3pm or 5pmThanks &amp;\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nAnil KUMAR | Procurement ManagerE&amp;C and Maint. Services. | LEC &amp; GeocycleLafarge Emirates Cement LLC - A member of Holcim GroupIdhn,Habhab ,Fujairah,UAEP.O.Box: 29966, Ras Al Khaimah - UAETel (+971) (7)\r\n2044702 / (+971) (7) 2044888, Ext- 404Mobile (+971) (55) 7008397 - Fax (+971) (7) 2448620Email : anil.kumar@lafargeholcim.comwww.lafarge.ae / www.holcim.comFind us on Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Instagram and YouTube \r\n\r\n On Thu, Feb 20, 2025 at 11:47 AM Himanshi Joshi &lt;himanshi.joshi@dice.tech&gt; wrote:Hi Anil , If Tuesday 4 PM works for you , please let me know.

This allows users to mark business visits seamlessly while providing the option to tag deviations for personal trips, ensuring these are excluded from business visits.\r\n\r\nThis approach offers enhanced compliance and visibility by capturing end-to-end information on client interactions and visit patterns.

Is there any specific API endpoint for uploading or retrieving attachments?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Is it possible to share detailed API documentation for the Expense Tracking System, including supported endpoints, request/response formats, and payload examples?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. What authentication mechanisms APIs supports (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys)?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Is there any IP whitelisting option or additional security requirements that needs to be configured?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. What is the API payload size and call limits for API requests?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. Is there any maximum size limit for attachments and what are the supported formats (e.g., PDF, JPEG, PNG)?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10.

Does Expense Tracking System’s APIs work two-way integration? Does it support SOAP based web services or REST API protocols.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n2. Any prior experience for Integration with Oracle E-Business Suite (ERP)? Any case study with Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n3. Few additional attributes are required to generate payable invoices in EBS (e.g., Org ID, Vendor ID, Vendor Site ID),\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindly confirm in case Expense Tracking System can accommodate new attributes in GUI as well as in APIs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n4. Is there any specific API endpoint for uploading or retrieving attachments?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n5. Is it possible to share detailed API documentation for the Expense Tracking System, including supported endpoints, request/response formats, and payload examples?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n6. What authentication mechanisms APIs supports (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys)?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n7. Is there any IP whitelisting option or additional security requirements that needs to be configured?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n8. What is the API payload size and call limits for API requests?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n9. Is there any maximum size limit for attachments and what are the supported formats (e.g., PDF, JPEG, PNG)?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n10. How integration errors are communicated (e.g., error codes, response messages)?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n11. Does APIs support retry mechanisms for failed transactions?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n12. Is there a sandbox or test environment we can use for integration testing?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n13. What format and data structure is required for sending batch element entries (e.g., JSON, XML)?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n14. Is there a unique identifier for each element entry to ensure no duplicate processing in Oracle?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n15. Is there an acknowledgment mechanism to confirm successful receipt of processed results in Expense Tracking System?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n16. Does Expense Tracking Software APIs support attachments (e.g., expense receipts) along with batch entries?\r\n\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If yes, how are these attachments linked to a specific transaction?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n17. How does Expense Tracking System handle invoice status updates sent back from Oracle?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n18. How frequently should the payment status updates be sent to Expense Tracking System (real-time, scheduled batches)?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n19. Is there a way to log or track changes for audit purposes?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n20. Please outline the expected response times (latency) and any defined timeouts for the Expense Tracking System APIs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n21. How does API versioning and backward compatibility is being handled.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n22. Does ExTS supports bulk upload to Employee Master through Excel / CSV file.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n23. Does ExTS supports bulk upload through excel / CSV file to other masters like Expense Type / Account Codes etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n______\r\n&nbsp;\r\nSanjay Agheda\r\nIT / LMS Coordinator\r\nPhone +971 4 2894670\r\nDirect +971 4 823 5289\r\nMobile +971 56 399 3998\r\nsanjay.agheda@georgfischer.com\r\n&nbsp;\r\nGF Corys\r\nP.O.

I enjoyed our conversation and am looking forward to our in-person meeting on\r\nMonday at 2:00 PM in Sharjah to discuss how\r\nDice can enhance procurement operations at\r\nGECO Mechanical &amp; Electrical Ltd.\r\nWith $300M in annual spend, 6,000 POs, and 15,000 invoices, streamlining\r\nsupplier onboarding, validation, intake, e-negotiation, auctioning, PO acceptance, and invoicing is key.\r\nDice seamlessly integrates with\r\nProcore and SAP ECC, enabling\r\nreal-time tracking, compliance, and automation for project-based procurement.\r\nIndustry leaders like GMR Group, Bajaj Electricals, and Tolaram Group use\r\nDice to streamline procurement and cut costs.\r\nGMR improved\r\nvendor onboarding by 30%,\r\nBajaj Electricals reduced\r\nprocurement cycles by 40%.We have also been working with Tolaram and GF Cory&#39;s in the Middle East.\r\nExcited to explore how we can bring similar efficiencies to GECO. Let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like to cover. \r\nSee you on Monday!\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHimanshi Joshi\r\nGrowth Consultant\r\n+91-9630827366\r\n\r\n\r\nDice\r\nwww.dice.tech\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
